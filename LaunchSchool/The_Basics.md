# The Basics

## Literals
- Is a FIxed Value that helps you to represent a FIxed Value in Source Code
## String
- It is a Sequence Of Charater arrange in specific sequence. We can Write String literals with either single or double quotes
## Symbols
- They are immutable string .Represented by placing a colon (:)before a word.
## numbers
- There are Two Ways We Can Represent number In a String 
  - Integer Literal Representation
  - Floating Point Literals
## Nil
- Its a Ruby Way Of Representing Nothing
## Operation
- + Stands for Addition
- - Stands for Subtraction
`and so On`
 use remainder module when dealing with negative Numbers
## Type Conversion
- String To integer = `to_i`
- Integer To String = `to_s`
## Basic Data Structure
- Two very Common Data Structures in Ruby are :
  -Array
  -Hashes

  ### Array
  - An array is used to organize information into an ordered list. The list can be made up of strings, integers, floats, booleans, or any other data type. 
  - Represent by [] Brackets
  ### Hash
  - Also Called 'Dictionary' it is a set of key-value pair.
  - Represented by {} 
  - Denoted using {key => value}
## Expression and Returns
- An Expression is anything that can be evaluated and pretty much everyting you write in Ruby is an Expression. An Expression in Ruby always return something, even that's a error message or `nil`. 
## Puts vs Returns
- When we call the puts method, we're telling Ruby to print something to the screen. However, puts does not return what is printed to the screen. Expressions do something, but they also return something. The value returned is not necessarily the action that was performed. Let's take a look in irb.
